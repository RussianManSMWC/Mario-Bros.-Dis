# Mario-Bros.-Dis
This is a byte-to-byte accurate disassembly of Mario Bros. (U) for NES.
It's not fully documented, so you can contribute by sending pull requests or something.

I didn't included graphics data for it, you'll have to get it yourself. Assembles with "asm6" assembler.
Also excuse me for wacky comment placement, thanks to Notepad++. It looks like I need to fix these by editing it in normal notepad. IDK.
